# Grant & Ecosystem Strategy

## 1. Product Positioning: Consumer vs Tooling
**Verdict**: OppForge is a **Consumer Application ("Super App")**.
-   **Why**: You serve end-users (hunters), not developers (tooling).
-   **Keywords**: "Onboarding", "Access", "Public Goods", "Education".
-   **Grant Track**: Look for **"Consumer Crypto"**, **"DeFi/Productivity"**, or **"Ecosystem Growth"**.

## 2. Ecosystem Priorities (Where the money is)

### A. Solana (Renaissance / Colosseum) — **Top Pick**
-   **Why**: Massive focus on "Consumer Apps".
-   **Grant**: Solana Foundation Grants / Radar Hackathons.
-   **Fit**: High. They love "super apps" that aggregate opportunities.
-   **Tech**: You must integrate Solana wallet connection + RPC (Helius).

### B. Base (Coinbase) — **Strong Runner Up**
-   **Why**: "Onchain Summer" grants for consumer apps.
-   **Grant**: Base Builder Grants.
-   **Fit**: High. They want tools that bring "normies" on-chain.

### C. Arbitrum (DAO Grants) — **Good for Tooling**
-   **Why**: Huge treasury.
-   **Fit**: Medium. They lean more towards DeFi/Infra tooling.

### D. Avalanche (AVAX) — **Poor Fit (Currently)**
-   **Why**: The "Build Games" grant is strictly for **Gaming**.
-   **Fit**: Low. OppForge is not a game.
-   **Pivot**: Unless you gamify it heavily ("XP for applying", "Leaderboards", "Quests"), you won't win a Gaming grant.

## 3. GitHub Strategy
**Recommendation**: Create a **GitHub Organization** (`OppForge-Labs` or similar).
-   **Repo**: Single **Monorepo** (`oppforge`) containing `frontend/` and `backend/`.
-   **Why**: Easier to manage one repo. Investors/Judges see all activity in one place.
-   **Professionalism**: An Org looks like a startup. A personal repo looks like a side project.

## 4. Immediate Action Plan for Grants
1.  **Deploy MVP** (Frontend + Dummy Backend) to Vercel.
2.  **Record Demo** (Loom video walking through the "Hunter Flow").
3.  **Apply to Solana Colosseum** (if open) or **Base Grants**.
